# constitutional-functions

Custom functions outside of functions.php. This ensures that if you switch themes, you won't lose widgets and other custom things. This is to serve as a base modification for custom theming.

sample.php - this has all functions I've used up to now. Do NOT remove sample from the file name and use. It is just the dumping ground. 

constitutional-functions.php - Modify this for use. Copy functions from the sample file for use here. Includes some bare minimums that I use on every project.

shortcodes.php - A shortcodes list/file I forked from a project I enherited. Couldn't find who originally used it, so I won't claim originality on it, but it combines work I've done to make things more user-friendly for the non-code friendly person. UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND NOT CURRENTLY CALLED IN THE constitutional-functions.php

wp_bootstrap_navwalker.php - A Bootstrap navwalker that I've used in nearly every project that has dropdown menus. Probably eventually will be done away with once WP has better support for Bootstrap classes, or we stop using dropdowns. (Github link on file)
